## About Me

Hello! I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student passionate about technology, software development, and continuous learning. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on a wide variety of projects that have allowed me to explore different programming languages, frameworks, and problem-solving approaches.

### Projects

- **Mobile Applications:** I have developed Android apps using Kotlin, such as [TravelPlanner](https://github.com/oRioL-Cesc-Android/TravelPlanner) and [Pokedex2.0](https://github.com/xertrec/Pokedex2.0), focusing on user experience and efficient data management.
- **Web Applications:** I have experience building web apps with technologies like Groovy and Grails, as seen in [F1_DATA](https://github.com/oRioL-04/F1_DATA) and [PokePack](https://github.com/oRioL-04/POKE_PACK), implementing both frontend and backend functionalities.
- **Backend Development:** I have worked on backend systems using JavaScript and Node.js, such as [virtual-rec-backend-oriol-cesc](https://github.com/WebProject-UdL-2425/virtual-rec-backend-oriol-cesc), applying RESTful API principles and database integration.
- **Academic Assignments:** My academic projects, like [algorithms-assignment-2-uriol_alberto](https://github.com/UdL-2324/algorithms-assignment-2-uriol_alberto), demonstrate my skills in Python and algorithmic problem-solving.
- **System Administration:** I have explored scripting and automation with Shell, Docker, and Makefile in repositories like [laboratoris](https://github.com/AMSA-2425-GEI-UDL/laboratoris).
- **Java Projects:** I am also proficient in Java, as shown in projects like [xarxes_Prac2](https://github.com/xBlanco/xarxes_Prac2) and [AutomataLlengua](https://github.com/xBlanco/AutomataLlengua).

### Skills

- Programming Languages: Kotlin, Java, Python, Groovy, JavaScript, Shell
- Frameworks: Android, Grails, Node.js
- Tools: Git, Docker, Makefile
- Other: REST APIs, Database Integration, Algorithm Design

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!
